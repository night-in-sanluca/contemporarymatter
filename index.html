          <h2>Stay comfortable and visit the City!</h2>
          <p class="font-italic">Between the VI and the VII century BC, the Etruscan founded the city of Felsina, in the site where today lies Bologna. The place was then occupied by a Gaulish population and,in 196 BC it became a Roman colony called Bononia. Known for being a cosmopolitan place, a great city known for its culture and for its University - the oldest in the world, Bologna is a real small treasure: an authentic "open air" museum to be discovered and visited!

            <h3>The two Towers: La Torre degli Asinelli and La Torre Garisenda</h3>
            <p>
              The two towers are the symbol of Bologna, they stand in the heart of the city, where the ancient Aemilian Way entered Bologna. The towers were both built in the same years (from 1109 to 1119). They had a military purpose, mainly defensive.  
             
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> The "Torre degli Asinelli" is the tallest medieval leaning tower: a 97,02-meters-tall building that has 496 steps in total. It was built by Asinelli noble family and it was recently restaurated. In the XIII century the tower was donated to the town. The Torre degli Asinelli is currently opened to the public and, from the top, it is possible to admire one of the most stunning panoramic views of Bologna.</li>
              <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> The "Torre Garisenda" is instead much shorter ("just" almost 48 meters tall) compared to "its companion". The tower was built in the same years and for the same purposes, even though it was soon shortened for the risk of collapse. In fact, the Garisenda was famous since Dante's period for a peculiarity: its subfoundations are partially beneath the ground, this slope caused its shortening. From the 15th until the 19th centuries, Garisenda had been property of the "Arte dei Drappieri", that used the place as a commercial palace. It was then donated to the Municipality. This tower cannot be visited.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> Piazza Maggiore is one of the oldest Italian squares, it is the true centre of Bologna. In the XIII century, the Municipality of Bologna agreed to transform a plot of land in a place in which markets could be hosted; it was thought as a meeting area. Many other famous Italian squares (such as Florence's and Siena's) were built after Piazza Maggiore, following this model. 
              The façade of the Basilica of San Petronio stands solemnly before the square. Next to the cathedral, moving in a clockwise direction it is possible to admire Palazzo dei Notai. Continuing in this way Palazzo d’Accursio and the Clock Tower, Palazzo del Podestà and Palazzo Bianchi can be seen one next to the other.</li>
              <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> Piazza del Nettuno lies next to Piazza Maggiore. It is very famous for the Fountain of the Neptune, a majestic Mannerist fountain based on three steps, made of bronze and marble of Verona. At the top of the fountain, the great bronze statue depicting the god Neptune towers the square. It was firstly designed by Giambologna, but then assebled and completed by the architect Laureti. The fountain was completed around 1567. Its construction was commissioned by the cardinal Charles Borromeo, to celebrate the election of Pope Pius IV, who actually was the cardinal's uncle.</li>

This palace was commissioned by the cardinal Charles Borromeo (along with the Fountain of the Neptune). It was built by the architect Morandi, between 1562 and 1563. Before 1803, it was the seat of the University of Bologna. In 1944 the Archiginnasio was damaged by a bombing raid, but after the war it was rebuilt. There are two halls for the scholars (closed to the public), a lectures hall for the artists (today a reading room) and the Hall of the Stabat Mater.</li>
                  <li><i class="icofont-check-circled"></i> Inside the Archiginnasio lies the well-known Anatomical Theatre (Teatro Anatomico), a hall once used for anatomy lectures, designed by Antonio Levante (1637) and built in carved wood.</li>

            <h3>Basilica di San Petronio</h3>
            <p>
              The church of San Petronio stands before Piazza Maggiore. It was built at the end of the XIV century, its style is identified as Italian Gothic and it was commissioned in honour of Bologna's patron saint (San Petronio). The basilica should have been the largest church in the word, however, pope Pius IV promoted instead the construction of the Archiginnasio, therefore stopping the ongoing works in the Basilica. Its façade is made of bricks and marble, creating a contrast between dark and light. Before 1511, the bronze statue of the pope Julius II, made by Michelangelo, standed on the façade. The statue was then destroyed. 
              Inside the church there are three naves and twenty-two chapels, each of them contains precious works of arts of the Renaissance and the Middle Ages. 
              It is also possible to access the terrace of the church, enjoying a beautiful panorama.

              This is one of the most famous squares of Bologna, it is not a "true square", but actually an open space among the complex of the "Seven Churches". On one side of the square there are respectively: the Basilica of Santo Stefano, Casa Berti, Palazzo Isolani and Palazzo Bolognini Isolani. On the other side there is instead Palazzo Bolognini Amorini Salina. The square hosts many cultural events.

              Giardini Margherita is the largest as well as the most popular park in Bologna covering 26 hectares. It was originally known as Passeggio Regina Margherita and its inauguration occurred in 1879. Its design was inspired by English Romantic gardens, with ponds, lawns and a greenhouse. Curiosity: an Etruscan burial ground was discovered during the construction of the park, a grave was found at the side of the central lawn. Moreover, inside the gardens lies a short open-air stretch of Savena canal, one of the ancient waterways of Bologna.

            <p>
              The Sanctuary of San Luca was nominated (with Bologna's porticoes) a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019. The Sanctuary is recognized as a very important place of religious worship; it is located on Colle della Guardia. The construction began in the XV century, the portico however was built in 1678. Since 1433, during the Ascension week, every year, a procession walks toward the cathedral carrying the Byzantine Madonna with Child. The Sanctuary church was rebuilt in the XVIII century, to replace the previous one. The landscapes that surround the Sanctuary are breathtaking: from the panoramic terrace, opened to the public in 2017, the visitors can enjoy a unique view from Bologna to the hills and Casalecchio di Reno.

                <p class="card-text">Quarantine and its consequent lock-down, pushed me to intensify the contact with nature in its multiple shapes and in particular with earth dimension and its potential to create life. This led me to focus on the importance of time dedicated to it and the response that nature offers when you give her your time and attention. Nature needs care, respect and waiting. Requires to synchronize on its rhythm. I dedicated myself to the home garden very actively and with extreme respect, in a creative and expressive dimension. I realized this facepainting in an instinctive way, as a tribute to Earth in all its declinations. That Earth that human being is exploiting, underestimating its dimension of hospitality for human being themselves and its strength and especially by neglecting the lesson it teaches us.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This series originates from a reflection upon the concept of the ritual within our age. A vast part of anthropology focused on its social dynamics, analyzing its adaptive and maladaptive aspects. Several studies have been done on rituals within the animal world and on their universal nature and questions have been raised whether they can exist outside the age and the context in which they were born. But if in some parts of the world ancient rituals are still practiced, it seems that, in some other places, time (and everything it involves) overwhelmed these gestures with several layers of superstructures, reducing their practice and stopping their transmission.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Pietas is dedicated to the millions of refugees that lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea.
It is to honour the scores of individuals, souls, talent, potential, hearts and minds of all those that we lost in those waters.
Again another human being has died.
And again a mother holds her dear creation in her arms, prematurely. Grieving, angry and warning those who see. This image is a gesture of piety. It beckons us to open the door and enter deep into our humanity. The more we repeat it the more powerful the symbol becomes. It has the capacity to make us understand and to transform us into heroes.
This is an invitation to feel what has happened. To do as they do and feel the weight of our hearts, our heroic ability to love. This is a complaint. A funeral.
To remember and to reflect.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This series of works takes inspiration from war images, most notably the ones of Paris following the Second World War.
 I stumbled upon these images during my year abroad in Paris. I remember being particularly touched by leftover fragments of stone from buildings that had been destroyed. I kept asking myself, ‘how can I turn these mementos into an artistic project?’ One that would speak about fragments and destruction but also about nature, as symbolised by stone as a material. I was surrounded by presses and metals. By destroying the copper sheet, I created 11 parts corresponding to the 11 shapes we now see printed on paper.
 The arrangement of the eleven parts is completely random to best reflect the essence of an explosion. This is also why I decided to name each part with a random number, so to strengthen the element of chance that characterises their creation</p>

Like a still image, this work aims to capture the explosion of a column with the fragmentation of its parts, at the climax of breaking. The will to represent its critical moment of "no return" puts this sculpture in a neutral state: it’s the observer himself who, thanks to his perception, will leave room for his own sensitivity, making assumptions and processing probable answers to the staging of its dynamism.</p>

                <p class="card-text">As implied by the title’s play on words, this work is part of a series of studies on my girlfriend, Nausicaa. With this oil on canvas, I tried to portray an analytical reality by utilising the trompe-l’oeil technique and by focusing the work on the yield of the surfaces, the lighting effect and the subject’s expression. All is immersed in a cold atmosphere, frozen just like the depicted moment.
 On the right of the subject, we can see the same canvas reversed in order to show its back (‘verso’ in Italian jargon), alluding to the Flemish painter Cornelius Norbertus Gysbrechts, known for revealing the blank canvas frame within the image. This choice seems to suggest the hidden meaning of this piece, as to advise the viewer to look further in order to discover what it’s normally concealed instead of relying on appearance. We can indeed understand a painting by looking at its reversed image.</p>

          <h2>Concept</h2>
          <p class="font-italic">The idea of a virtual museum where both the streets and monuments of Bologna and an entirely digitalized art-exhibition in San Luca's porticos came after experiencing the quarantine caused by Covid-19 pandemy. The entire world found itself locked down, in a state of emergency: everybody must stay home, the majority of commercial activities and institutions were closed for months. Among them there are schools, restaurants, libraries, museums: these places firstly promote and transmit our cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible. Even walking along the streets of a town, admiring its monuments and road, was forbidden. Our lives changed. We wanted to tell our experience, our point of view of students of the University of Bologna. We wanted to recreate an environment where the user can enjoy Bologna's street and panoramic views, from a realistic perspective. Moreover, we wanted to create a virtual exhibition of young, independent artist: their works are "exposed" onto the 3D model of San Luca's porticos' walls. We thought about a fellow student who was forced to spend the lockdown in another place, without the possibility to go back to Bologna, or about a foreigner who would like to visit the city, but was prevented to do it due to the pandemy. We thought about anyone who loves and misses Bologna and about anyone who loves art, culture and nature. Our hope is to let them visit Bologna and enjoy an original art exhibition in one of the most iconic place near the city, from their own homes.</p>

              <h4><a href="#">Development</a></h4>
              <p>The idea was to create a website where to embed 360° Street Views links from Google Maps. Each of the views had to show an important place related to Bologna or a particular monument; fullscreen view can be enabled to optimize the "visit", next to the embedded street views was put a brief description of the given place. We chose to enrich the project by adding a virtual art exhibition, with the help of the modeling tool Blender and the render engine Unity, following the same theme based on the city of Bologna. Also the exhibition is set in an open air environment, the porticos of The Sanctuary of San Luca. That place was chosen for its beauty and its importance: it is UNESCO's patrimony and it is beloved and visited by people of different ages and from different places. The idea dealt with the exposition of digital artworks "onto" a 3D reproduction of San Luca's porticos. This virtual exhibition comes at last, on of the final sections of the website, after "visiting" all the other streets, monuments, palaces and squares of Bologna. The artists that provided their works for the virtual exhibition were all young, and eager to share their creations.</p>

              <h4><a href="#">User Experience</a></h4>
              <p>Creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface was one of our main goals. We tried as much as possibile to build sections that are self-explanatory, a clear layout, an easy way to navigate through the 360° street views and to keep high the quality of digital arts. The user can explore the tridimensional environment of the views, zooming and rotating to every direction, as if he or she was actually "immersed" in the real environment. Furthermore, the exhibition of San Luca is thought as if the user was actually crossing the porticos and enjoying the work of arts, even thought everything is virtual, and completely born-digital. Undobtedly, the project is just a test, and it can be further developed and improved. In this case, further surveys and researches in user experience field must be carried out.</p>

The Google app will then automatically stitch the photos together, creating the 360° immersive view.</li>
              	<li>3D Modeling tools: Blender. The 3d model in .blend format was downloaded from an open source archive storing digital models of Bologna's monuments; it was then imported into Blender for applying the digital arts (as tridimensional canvas) onto the porticos model.</li>
              	<li>Render engine: Unity. To render the 3D models, it was used the engine Unity. It helped in the process of uploading the objects on the website.</li>
